# Slippage Analyzed

This code is a trading robot that analyzes slippage in the Forex market. It calculates the slippage for each trade order and generates a slippage analysis report.

## How it works

The code consists of several functions that perform different tasks:

1. `RetrieveTradeOrders()`: This function retrieves trade orders from the trading platform and populates the `trades` array with the trade details.

2. `CalculateSlippage()`: This function calculates the slippage for each trade order by subtracting the close price from the open price. It also updates the total slippage and the count of trades with slippage.

3. `GenerateSlippageReport()`: This function generates a slippage analysis report for a specified period. It calculates the average slippage by dividing the total slippage by the number of trades with slippage. The report includes the total slippage, the number of trades with slippage, and the average slippage.

4. `OnStart()`: This is the main function that executes the steps in the following order: 
   a. Retrieve trade orders.
   b. Calculate slippage.
   c. Generate slippage analysis report.
